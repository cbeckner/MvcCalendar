As such, there are several overloads that you can take advantage of.\r\n\r\nYou can specify the month that you want the calendar to display by passing in a *DateTime* object.\r\n```asp\r\n@Html.Calendar(DateTime.Now)\r\n```\r\n\r\n##Events\r\n\r\nYou can also fill the calendar with events by passing in a list of *CalendarEvent* objects.\r\n```asp\r\n@{\r\n  var events = new List<CalendarEvent>();\r\n  events.Add(new CalendarEvent(new DateTime(2014, 1, 15), new DateTime(2014, 1, 20), \"#333333\", \"viewDate(12345\"));     \r\n}\r\n@=Html.Calendar(DateTime.Now,events)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe *CalendarEvent* object takes the following arguments:\r\n* **StartDate** : The date the event begins.\r\n* **EndDate** : The date the event ends.\r\n* **DisplayColor** : The color that will be applied to the event when it is placed on the calendar. (optional. defaults to #999999)\r\n* **CallbackFunction** : A javascript function that will be called when the event is clicked on. (optional)\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the *CalendarEvent* class exposes two functions.\r\n* **Dates** : Enumerates all of the dates included in the event to include the start and end date.\r\n* **ContainsDate(DateTime)** : Returns true/false depending whether the provided date is in the range of Dates.\r\n\r\n##Styling\r\nThere is an additional helper that will provide some out of the box styling for the calendar.  This should be called prior to calling the first calendar on your page.  If you want to override one or two of the styles, I would suggest calling the css helper in the head of the site and then overriding the classes in your pages stylesheet.\r\n\r\nTo call the CSS control\r\n```asp\r\n@Html.CalendarCss()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe CSS exposes the following classes:\r\n* **.cal-body** : This styles the table element for the calendar\r\n* **.cal-body th** : The style for the header elements.  This will define how the days of the week are displayed.\r\n* **.cal-body td** : The style for the dates.  This will define alignment and cell size.\r\n* **.cal-body a** : How any callback links should be styled.  \r\n* **.cal-x** : How empty (non-date) cells should be rendered.\r\n* **.cal-ar** : How the end date will be rendered. By default it is an triangle.\r\n* **.cal-al** : How the start date will be rendered.  By default it is a triangle.\r\n\r\nCopyright 2014 by Cody Beckner!\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
